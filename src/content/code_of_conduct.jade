  Ruby Bangladesh conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of

  religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.
  Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and
  other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without
  a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.
